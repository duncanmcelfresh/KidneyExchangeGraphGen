# Generate Stochastic Kronecker Graphs
Generate SKGs using SNAP and calculate graph properties.


## Stochastic Kronecker Graph (SKGs)
SKGs are stochastic graphs generated by taking successive Kronecker powers of an initial stochastic adjacency matrix. Efficient methods exist to both 1) fit the SKG model to existing graphs, and 2) to generate new SKGs. The SKG model was introduced in [this paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/leskovec10a.html), which demonstrated that even the simplest form of this model can produce graphs with realistic properties.


## Installation Instructions ##
This codebase generates and analyzes SKGs using the [Stanford Network Analysis Project library](https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap) (SNAP) and the [SNAP python interface](http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/doc/). Both the SNAP library and its python interface need to be installed for these functions to work.
1. Install SNAP ([link](https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap)).  Clone that repository, then run `make all` in the root directory of wherever you cloned the repository.  
2. Install other Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  This will install NumPy, Matplotlib, and the SNAP Python API.
3. Some functions take the SNAP installation directory as a parameter.  Open `config.py` and change line 15 to point to wherever you installed SNAP.
