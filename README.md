# Generate Stochastic Kronecker Graphs
Code for generating SKGs using SNAP and calculate graph properties, in Python 2.7.11.

## Stochastic Kronecker Graph (SKGs)
SKGs are stochastic graphs generated by taking successive Kronecker powers of an initial stochastic adjacency matrix. Efficient methods exist to both 1) fit the SKG model to existing graphs, and 2) to generate new SKGs. The SKG model was introduced in [this paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/leskovec10a.html), which demonstrated that even the simplest form of this model can produce graphs with realistic properties.

## skg_functions.py
This file contains functions for generating and analyzing SKGs using the [Stanford Network Analysis Project library](https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap) (SNAP) and the [SNAP python interface](http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/doc/). Both the SNAP library and its python interface need to be installed for these functions to work. Some functions take the SNAP installation directory as a parameter.

**Required modules:**
* SNAP ([link](https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap))
* snap  (python interface: [link](http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/doc/))

## example.py
This script generates 10 SKGs, calculates some graph properties using skg_functions.py, and plots the in-degree distributions.

**Required python modules:**
* skg_functions.py
* numpy
* matplotlib
