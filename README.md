# Generate Stochastic Kronecker Graphs
Generate SKGs using SNAP and calculate graph metrics

## Stochastic Kronecker Graph (SKGs)
SKGs are stochastic graphs generated by taking successive Kronecker powers of an initial stochastic adjacency matrix. Efficient methods exist to both 1) fit the SKG model to existing graphs, and 2) to generate new SKGs. The SKG model was introduced in [this paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/leskovec10a.html), which demonstrated that even the simplest form of this model can produce graphs with realistic properties.

## skg_functions.py
This file contains functions for generating and analyzing SKGs using the [Stanford Network Analysis Project library](https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap) (SNAP) and the [SNAP python interface](http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/doc/). 

**Required modules:**
* snap ([link](http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/doc/))

## example.py
This script generates 10 SKGs, calculates some graph properties using skg_functions.py, and plots the in-degree distributions.

**Required modules:**
* skg_functions.py
* numpy
* matplotlib
